At Comcast Silicon Valley Innovation Center, I currently work on Xfinity channel store billing system. Before that I was involved in building watchable.com.

Prior to Comcast, I was running [yotta-e](https://www.yotta-e.com/) supporting Bitcoin ecosystem.

In my free time I try to keep up with crypto world, learn more about our past and future, as well as playing basketball.
