At Comcast Silicon Valley Innovation Center, I currently work on Xfinity channel store backend. Before that I was involved in building [watchable](https://www.watchable.com/).

Prior to Comcast, I was running [yotta-e](https://www.yotta-e.com/) supporting Bitcoin ecosystem.

In my free time I try to keep up with crypto world, learn something about our past and future, as well as keep fit.
